SQL Notes:

Use this for parsing a key. This can be useful if needed for creating joins off keys.
split_part for reading a substring until a delimiter.
SPLIT_PART(expression varchar, delimiter varchar, part_number int32)

This 
Example: apprsr_key = split_part(apprsr_key , '|' , 1)

substring (charindex () ) may also work but is untested.
