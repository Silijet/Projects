SQL Notes:
-----

Use this for parsing a key. This can be useful if needed for creating joins off keys.

SPLIT_PART(expression varchar, delimiter varchar, part_number int32)
Example: apprsr_key = split_part(apprsr_key , '|' , 1)

substring (charindex () ) may also work but is untested.

-----

When the datetime listed is in unixtime, it needs to be converted in order for it to be read easily. The amount of trailing zeros is variable but a typical amount is 6, so dividing by 1,000,000 is common.

from_unixtime(input field / amount to remove trailing zeros)
Example: from_unixtime(loss_dttm/1000000)

-----

If a field is a timestamp type, then filtering it using a conditional will require converting the input into a timestamp data type.

to_timestamp (input value, return value)
Example: WHERE crt_dttm >= to_timestamp ('01-02-2022 00:00:01' , 'dd-mm-yyyy hh24:mi:ss')
