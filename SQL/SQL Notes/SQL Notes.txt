SQL Notes:

Use this for parsing a key. This can be useful if needed for creating joins off keys.
split_part for reading a substring until a delimiter.
SPLIT_PART(expression varchar, delimiter varchar, part_number int32)

This 
Example: apprsr_key = split_part(apprsr_key , '|' , 1)

substring (charindex () ) may also work but is untested.

When the datetime listed is in unixtime, it needs to be converted in order for it to be read easily.
from_unixtime(input field / amount to remove trailing zeros) --a typical amount of trailing zeros could be 6, so divide by 1000000
Example: from_unixtime(loss_dttm/1000000)
