A list of personal projects that I've made. Many of these should be based on class assignments or coding challenges, but will be slightly altered or tailored to either a more specific problem or to generalize it and make it more robust. For example, instead of just finding the 10 most common words in a text, I will design the function to find any number of words based on manual inputs. It will be ongoing and be a demonstration of my coding ability. Hopefully will be able to add to it on a daily basis and show increasing complexity.

Currently using mostly Python3. However, I will also be adding some SQL to this repository. I want to have example problems that I've worked out on data sets and then posssibly create models for general purpose queries that may be commonly used. I've included some projects that I have worked on while employed (with permission from my employers) and I hope that it displays my knowledge of SQL. 

I'll also include a link to my Tableau profile here to show some visualizations that I've done on sample data sets.
