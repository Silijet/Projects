A list of personal projects that I've made via Python3. Many of these should be based on class assignments or coding challenges. It will be ongoing and be a demonstration of my coding ability. Hopefully will be able to add to it on a daily basis and show increasing complexity.

I'll also include a link to my Tableau profile here to show some visualizations that I've done on sample data sets.
